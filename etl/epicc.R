# EPICC ETL PIPELINE (Refactored, Metadata-Driven) ----
#
# This script implements a metadata-driven column typing ETL for EPICC,
# returning a nested list of raw and transformed objects instead of writing to
# the global environment as has been done in the past. It replaces the legacy
# monolithic ETL child doc with a clean, testable, and maintainable workflow.
#
# ===
#
#  Core design principles:
#   - PathClient is the authoritative event timeline (one row per enrollment)
#   - TIEDENROLLMENT is the canonical episode join key
#   - Form tables (REF, IC, TWOW, THIRTYD, THREEM, SIXM, REENGAGE) are
#       joined to PathClient by TIEDENROLLMENT
#   - SCD summation tables (intake, payor, housing) are joined by
#       PARENT_DOCSERNO to all possible parent forms (REF/IC/follow-ups)
#   - Active SCD summation tables are joined into epicc_full_data (one row per
#       enrollment); “all” SCD summation tables remain long form for reporting
#   - All form columns are prefixed with form name (ref_, ic_, twow_,
#       thirtyd_, threem_, sixm_, reengage_, intake_, payor_, housing_)
#
#       * intake = EPICC SU Tx Referred Agency summation from PWSUBROADTXAGENCY
#
# ===
#
# HOW THIS SCRIPT IS ORGANIZED
#
# 1. File paths
#      - All EPICC extract paths are defined in `epicc_paths`, using make_path()
#
# 2. Ingestion functions (load_epicc_*)
#      - Each function loads one EPICC extract using metadata from
#        analytic_fields (loaded via load_analytic_fields() in helpers.R)
#      - No column types are hard-coded; all typing is metadata-driven
#      - No renaming or cleanup should occur here
#
# 3. Transformation functions (transform_epicc_*)
#      - Each function performs one major transformation step:
#          * transform_epicc_pathclient()
#          * transform_epicc_referral_flow()
#      - These functions join related extracts
#      - They return lists so Data Team staff can inspect intermediate objects
#      - epicc-pathclient is pivoted to ensure one row per enrollment
#      - Event forms are cleaned to drop notes fields and *_code fields, prefix
#          all columns with form name, and preserve only client_number and
#          tiedenrollment as join keys
#      - SCD summation tables are cleaned to rename parent_docserno, prefix all
#          columns, and drop client_number from each. parent_docsernos are
#          joined to the first non-NA docserno from among the parent forms
#
# 4. Semantic wrapper function extract_epicc_full_data() returns the final,
#      analysis-ready, wide EPICC dataset (one row per enrollment). Subsetting
#      may be performed in the parent report projects using the build_subsets()
#      function in helpers.R.
#
# 5. Entry point
#      - run_epicc_etl(...)
#      - Orchestrates ingestion → transformation → assembly
#      - Designed to be used as a {targets} target (e.g., epicc_etl)
#      - Returns a nested list of all EPICC objects; writing .rds files is
#          handled elsewhere in the ETL repo
#
# ===
#
# INSPECTING INTERMEDIATE OBJECTS
#
# The ETL returns a nested list so Data Team staff can inspect intermediate
#   objects without relying on global environment side effects.
#
# Example:
#   * epicc <- run_epicc_etl(epicc_paths)
#
# Inspect raw ingestion tibbles:
#   * View(epicc$raw$epicc_client) # raw epicc_client
#   * View(epicc$raw$epicc_pathclient) # raw epicc_pathclient
#
# Inspect intermediate transformations:
#   * View(epicc$transform$pathclient$joined_pathclient) # pivoted
#     epicc_pathclient
#   * View(epicc$transform$referral_flow$joined_referral_flow) # full joined
#     pathclient with pathway event tibbles and scd tables
#
# Inspect final full dataset:
#   * View(epicc$epicc_full_data) # wide, one row per enrollment
#
# This structure is intended to make debugging, onboarding, and unit testing
#   straightforward and to avoid reliance on global environment.
#
# However, if needed, one may assign objects to the global environment:
#   * epicc_pathclient_raw <- epicc$raw$epicc_pathclient
#
# ===
#
# ABOUT EPICC DATA STRUCTURE
#
# EPICC enrollments are composed of multiple data sources:
#
#   * ProviderPlacement (program enrollment and dismissal - not joined)
#   * Client (demographics)
#   * PathClient (Pathway metadata bridge)
#   * Referral
#   * IC (Initial Contact)
#   * Intake (active/all; referral to su tx agency and intake attempts)
#   * Follow-ups (two-week, thirty-day, three-month, six-month)
#   * Re-engagement (30-day re-engagement attempts)
#   * Housing and Payor Source (active/all)
#
# The transformation layer reconstructs this program life cycle for each
#   enrollment.
#
# ===
#
# REPORTING SUBSETS
#
# EPICC reporting uses two primary fiscal-period subsets:
#
#   1. dismissed_within_period
#        - Used for outcomes
#        - Includes all enrollments dismissed in the fiscal period
#
#   2. initiated_within_period
#        - Used for referral flow and program management
#        - Includes all enrollments initiated in the fiscal period,
#          regardless of whether they remain active or were dismissed
#
# Additional subsets are also possible but have not been added as of this
#   writing.
#
# ===

# ===
# 1. List file paths for all data source files. ----
#   - Uses function make_path() from helpers.R.

# 3. Transformation Layer Overview ----
#
# The transformation layer converts raw EPICC extracts (loaded via
# metadata-driven ingestion) into analysis-ready datasets.
#
# This layer is intentionally modular. Each function performs one major
# transformation step so that:
#   - Data Team staff can debug intermediate objects
#   - each step can be tested independently
#   - the ETL pipeline is readable and maintainable
#
# The major transformation steps are:
#   1. transform_epicc_pathclient()
#        - joins client demographics and relocates to left side of tibble
#        - pivots Pathway Event form docsernos to columns
#        - retains only client demographics + enrollment metadata + docsernos
#
#   2. transform_epicc_referral_flow()
#        - joins Pathway Event forms (ref, ic, twow, etc.)
#        - joins SCD tables (active intake, active payor, active housing)
#
#   5. build_epicc_full_data()
#        - returns joined_referral_flow as a unified dataset
#
#   6. build_epicc_subsets() (optional)
#        - constructs reporting subsets, including:
#            * dismissed-within-fiscal-year (for outcomes)
#            * initiated-within-fiscal-year (for referral flow)
#
# All intermediate objects are returned as list elements so Data Team staff can
# inspect them interactively during development.
# ===

# ===
# Transform epicc_pathclient ----
#   - PathClient is the authoritative event timeline (enrollment, dismissal,
#       pathway events)
#   - Pivot to one row per enrollment
#   - Drop Pathway metadata columns
#   - Keep analytic fields (enrollment dates, dismissal, agency, etc.)
